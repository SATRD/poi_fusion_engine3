OCDB Integration
================

IF you intend to export some data generated by the FE to the OCDB you should do the following:

1) Go to OCDB ((https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/OCDB) and install it
In the folder <ocdb_install_dir>/lib/resources/opendata  you can find an example of data importation. You may have a first look at it, if you want

2) Change some OCDB code

Copy endpoints.js   				to  <ocdb_install_dir>/lib/							(here we just added a new endpoint)
Copy Poi.model.js   				to  <ocdb_install_dir>/lib/models					(here we just added an 'attributes' variable to include metadata related to the Poi)
Copy Poi.js							to  <ocdb_install_dir>/lib/resources				(just check for 'UPV ADDED' comments)
Copy Media.js						to  <ocdb_install_dir>/lib/resources				(just check for 'UPV ADDED' comments)
Copy import.opendata.valencia.js	to  <ocdb_install_dir>/lib/resources/opendata		(this is the import script)


Edit the import.opendata.valencia.js script and change the variables 'APIBASE' and 'categories' according to your needs 

Open a console in <ocdb_install_dir>/lib/resources/opendata and type
$ node import.opendata.valencia.js
