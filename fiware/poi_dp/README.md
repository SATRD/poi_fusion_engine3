POI DP Integration
==================

IF you intend to export some data generated by the FE to the POI Data Provider you should do the following:

1) Open the 'index.html' file placed in this folder

2) Fill in the required parameters

- POI_DP base inquiry API (e.g. http://localhost/poi_dp/)
- FE FrontEnd base URL (e.g. http://localhost:8080/fic2_fe_v3_frontend/citysdk/)
- OCDs you want to export (e.g. valencia_demo, tenerife_demo)

3) Click on start. It will start inserting POIs from FE towards POI DP

Notes: 
a) The POI-DP restricts the name length to 31 characters. Those POIs in the FE that exceed such value will provide an error. You might cut the length of the name string. The js script does it
b) Only the 'fw_core' of the POI Spec is filled. The additional metadata is lost as there is no specific fw component to include such data. You may want to create your own component, but hits implies changing the code in the current POI DP GE, as it does not support it 
c) The script just inserts the POIs in the POI DP GE. It does not check whether they are already there. So if you launch the script twice or more you will get duplicated POIs
